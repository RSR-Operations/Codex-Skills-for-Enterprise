# Skill Packs

Skill packs install related Codex Skills together for a team workflow. Packs are defined in `skill-packs.json` and installed with the local repository installer.

## Install Commands

List available skills and packs:

```bash
python3 scripts/install_skill.py --list
```

Install one skill:

```bash
python3 scripts/install_skill.py ci-failure-triage
```

Install a pack:

```bash
python3 scripts/install_skill.py --pack engineering-ops
```

Preview an install:

```bash
python3 scripts/install_skill.py --dry-run --pack revenue-ops
```

Install to a custom destination:

```bash
python3 scripts/install_skill.py --dest /tmp/codex-skills --pack knowledge-ops
```

Existing skills are not overwritten unless `--force` is passed.

## Adoption Pattern

Start with one pack, one workflow owner, and real artifacts. Run a forward test, compare output against the current team standard, and only then roll the pack out more broadly.
